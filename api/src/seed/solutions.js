After 2 minutes plug the unit back into the outlet and rotate the knob to wake up the controls.  Start the cycle or set to Drain-and-Spin and then START.Ensure that the unit is plugged into a live working outlet -- check for any thrown breakers or blown fuses.Make sure that the drain hose is not pushed too far down the household drain if it is a drain-pipe or stand-pipe.  No more than 5 inches of the hose should be inside the pipe.An airgap is needed where the hose is attached to the drain.  To create an airgap, where the drain hose is inserted into the drain-pipe, ensure there is a space between the hose and the pipe.  The drain hose should NOT fit snuggly inside of the drain-pipe.  Ther drain-pipe should be a minimum of 1 to 1.5 inches in diameter.  Do not place tape over the needed space (airgap) between the hose and the drain-pipe.Excess suds can also cause this problem.  If you see suds in the load, re-wash the load without detergent.  For future loads, be sure to use the recommended amount of detergent per the packaging, or use H.E.

When this occurs, the washer is taking actions to correct the out-of-balance condition and complete the cycle normally.  In some cases, the washer may not be able to balance the load and spin-up to full speed.  If you notice the load is more wet than normal at the end of the cycle -- then, manually, re-distribute the load evenly in the tub and run a DRAIN-and-SPIN cycle.During spin if you see the SPIN light blinking - and - you also hear water fill the tub, agitating sounds, and no spinning, then the unit is attempting to auto-balance the load.  It will try the auto-balance sequence multiple times to successfully spin-up to full speed.  The sequence is as follows:The washer will stop spinning, will fill with a small amount of water, and agitate to re-distribute the load.The load will then drain and attempt to spin-up to full speed, but will only achieve this if the load successfully auto-balanced making a more evenly distributed load.If the load remains out-of-balance, the washer will try the auto-balance again.If the load never successfully auto-balances, the unit will cycle OFF, you may notice the load is wetter than normal, manually re-distribute the load, and run a DRAIN-and-SPIN cycle.If LID LOCK LIGHT IS FLASHING check your lid for the probe that sticks-out from the rim around the inner edge of the lid -- this probe engages and opening when the lid is down.  This is a safety feature to ensure the lid is down when the appliance is in spin mode.  If the probe is missing or damaged, I can send you another one.IF LID LOCK LIGHT IS ON (light is solid / not flashing)The washer will not spin when it has water remaining in the tub.  Check to see if the washer can drain properly by ensure that the drain hose is not pinched, kinked, or flattened.You can reset the control panel by disconnecting from power for 2 minutes and re-connecting to power.  Set the cycle to DRAIN-and-SPIN to see if the appliance will operate properly.Different fabrics (towels, robes, sweatpants, denim, or other dense materials) absorb and retain moisture within the folds of the items following the spin cycle; also, cold water temperatures can make itmes feel heavier as if they did not spin-out enough.  In conditions like this, you can set the cycle to DRAIN-and-SPIN to spin the items again.Ensure that the washer is connect to a live working outlet.  It may be necessary to check the circuit breakers or fuses, and reset breaker or change blown fuses if needed.ALSO NOTE:The washer could be overloaded:  Reduce the load size.  When loading, the dry items to be washed should not reach any higher than the TOP ROW of holes in the tub of a top-loading washer.Select a cycle with a faster spin speed.  For instance, when using Delicates or Light wash, the spin speed is slower than other cycles like Regular, Heavy, Permanent Press, or Cottons; therefore, the load may retain moisture.Excess suds can also cause this problem.  If large amounts of suds are seen, re-wash the load WITHOUT detergent.  For  future loads, be sure to use the correct amount of detergent as prescribed on the detergent packaging.  Also consider using low-sudsing detergents.  GE recommends the use of H.E. (high-efficiency) detergents.The drain pump may be clogged -- a service call will be required to correct this issue.",

The sequence is as follows:\n <li>\n  The washer will stop spinning, will fill with a small amount of water, and agitate to re-distribute the load.\n </li>\n <li>\n  The load will then drain and attempt to spin-up to full speed, but will only achieve this if the load successfully auto-balanced making a more evenly distributed load.\n </li>\n <li>\n  If the load remains out-of-balance, the washer will try the auto-balance again.\n </li>\n <li>\n  If the load never successfully auto-balances, the unit will cycle OFF, you may notice the load is wetter than normal, manually re-distribute the load, and run a DRAIN-and-SPIN cycle.\n </li>\n <p>\n  If LID LOCK LIGHT IS FLASHING\n </p>\n <li>\n  Check your lid for the probe that sticks-out from the rim around the inner edge of the lid -- this probe engages and opening when the lid is down.  This is a safety feature to ensure the lid is down when the appliance is in spin mode.  If the probe is missing or damaged, I can send you another one.\n </li>\n <p>\n  IF LID LOCK LIGHT IS ON (light is solid / not flashing)\n </p>\n <li>\n  The washer will not spin when it has water remaining in the tub.  Check to see if the washer can drain properly by ensure that the drain hose is not pinched, kinked, or flattened.\n </li>\n <li>\n  You can reset the control panel by disconnecting from power for 2 minutes and re-connecting to power.  Set the cycle to DRAIN-and-SPIN to see if the appliance will operate properly.\n </li>\n <li>\n  Different fabrics (towels, robes, sweatpants, denim, or other dense materials) absorb and retain moisture within the folds of the items following the spin cycle; also, cold water temperatures can make itmes feel heavier as if they did not spin-out enough.  In conditions like this, you can set the cycle to DRAIN-and-SPIN to spin the items again.\n </li>\n <li>\n  Ensure that the washer is connect to a live working outlet.  It may be necessary to check the circuit breakers or fuses, and reset breaker or change blown fuses if needed.\n </li>\n <p>\n  ALSO NOTE:\n </p>\n <li>\n  The washer could be overloaded:  Reduce the load size.  When loading, the dry items to be washed should not reach any higher than the TOP ROW of holes in the tub of a top-loading washer.\n </li>\n <li>\n  Select a cycle with a faster spin speed.  For instance, when using Delicates or Light wash, the spin speed is slower than other cycles like Regular, Heavy, Permanent Press, or Cottons; therefore, the load may retain moisture.\n </li>\n <li>\n  Excess suds can also cause this problem.  If large amounts of suds are seen, re-wash the load WITHOUT detergent.  For  future loads, be sure to use the correct amount of detergent as prescribed on the detergent packaging.  Also consider using low-sudsing detergents.  GE recommends the use of H.E. (high-efficiency) detergents.\n </li>\n <li>\n  The drain pump may be clogged -- a service call will be required to correct this issue.\n </li>\n <p>\n </p>\n</span>",

Start the cycle or set to Drain-and-Spin and then START.\n </li>\n <li>\n  Ensure that the unit is plugged into a live working outlet -- check for any thrown breakers or blown fuses.\n </li>\n <li>\n  Make sure that the drain hose is not pushed too far down the household drain if it is a drain-pipe or stand-pipe.  No more than 5 inches of the hose should be inside the pipe.\n </li>\n <li>\n  An airgap is needed where the hose is attached to the drain.  To create an airgap, where the drain hose is inserted into the drain-pipe, ensure there is a space between the hose and the pipe.  The drain hose should NOT fit snuggly inside of the drain-pipe.  Ther drain-pipe should be a minimum of 1 to 1.5 inches in diameter.  Do not place tape over the needed space (airgap) between the hose and the drain-pipe.\n </li>\n <li>\n  DRAINING AND FILLING AT THE SAME TIME:  Water may be draining from the tub at the same time that it is filling the tub -- this is called SIPHONING (sy-funning).  This can occur if your household drain for the washer is less than 3 feet tall.  If the drain you use for washer is very low or, perhaps, in the floor, we supply you with an anti-siphon clip that clips to and raises the drain hose to an acceptable height at the back of the washer to compensate for the low house drain for the washer.  Using the anti-siphon clip will prevent siphoning.  I can send you one, in the meantime, you can tape the washer drain hose to the back of the control panel until the anti-siphon clip arrives.  This height should be sufficient to prevent the siphoning.\n </li>\n <li>\n  Excess suds can also cause this problem.  If you see suds in the load, re-wash the load without detergent.  For future loads, be sure to use the recommended amount of detergent per the packaging, or use H.E. (high-efficiency) low sudsing detergents.\n </li>\n <li>\n  The drain pump may be clogged, service should be scheduled to correct this issue.\n </li>\n <p>\n </p>\n</span>",

        "raw_content": "Washer:  Wash Performance => Check each of the following to resolve STAINING ISSUES:  Rust Stains.  Orange tine to clothing or orange spots on garments may be rust stains.  High iron-content or rust in the water supply can cause an overall orange tint to the wash water, which is absorbed by the clothing when placed in the tub full of this type of water.  We fabric contact with unfinished metals, such as zippers, snaps, or gooks, may also cause rust stains on garments.Fabric Softener.  Light blue, light pink, or transparent oily stains are usually the result of fabric softener coming in direct contact with the garment.  Stains of the type may have a slight fabric softener smell to them, and are caused by not diluting liquid fabric softener before use, or by interrupting the spin cycle which dispenses the fabric softener, and/or by pouring fabric softener directly into the wash load instead of using the fabric softener dispenser.Colored Stains.  If the stain is blue, green, purple, pink, red, or the like, it usually means dye from another garment washed in the same load transferred to this item.  These colors are not used in the manufacture of the washer.  Dye transfer generally occurs when unstable dyes are used to color fabric.  Color bleeding from one section of the fabric to another, and damp items left lying in the washer after the cycle completes, or left in a pile prior to laundering can also cause dye transfer.  The manufacturer of the garment is ultimately responsible for selecting and testing appropriate dyes, as well as, providing accurate care labels.Chemical damage.  Chemical damage can be caused by chlorine bleach, battery acid, hydrogen peroxide (found in some acne madications), or certain haircare products.  Chemical damage may cause holes in clothing that appear over time as the chemical weakens the fabric.  Example:  Someone has been swimming in chlorinated water and then lays their wet towel on some other articles of clothing, the chlorine in the towel can be strong enough to transfer to the other garments.Soap Residue and Lint.  Stains that look like faded garment coloring, white patches or streaks, or areas of excessive lint are typically due to soap redisdue onthe item.  This condition occurs when too much detergent is used in the wash load, the detergent is not getting dissolved adequately, and/or very hard water conditions exist.  Soap residue may be a condition that has built up over time and multiple washing.  Powder detergents typically perform better than liquid and leave less residue.Soil transfer.  If the stain or garment feels greasy and has a dingy appearance, it is an indication of overall poor cleaning.  Low water temperature, improper sorting, and improper use of detergent can result in stains or soil transfer from one garment to another.Pinched stains.  Pinched stains are often gray or black in color and appear as though the garment was caught or pinged.  If the stains show up at the end of a wash cycle, the garments may be getting caught between the tub and tube cover or under the base of the agitator.  While it is unusual for this to happen, it is more likely to occur is the wash is being overloaded.  If the pinched stans appear only after dryer drying, they may be caused by a mis-aligned or overloaded dryer drum.  A garment may get caught between the dry drum and another surface in the dryer resulting in this type of staining.  If the dryer is not level, there is an increased risk of clothe getting caught by the drum",

The SANITIZE feature on your washer uses an internal heater in the washer to set the water temperature to about 151 degrees Fahrenheit to achieve sanitization per NSF Protocol P172 and kill more than 99.9-percent of many common bacteria found in home laundry.  For best results, select the extra heavy soil setting when using the Sanitize Cycle.SANITIZE WITH OXI feature on your washer uses water directly from your household hot water supply, along with an Oxi additive and laundry detergent to achieve sanitization per NSF Protocol P172.  It is designed to remove 99.9-percent of bacteria found in home laundry. Measure the detergent and the Oxi products carefully. Using the amounts appropriate for a large, heavily soild load (regardless of your actual load size), follow the detergent and the Oxi product label instructions. The detergent should be added into the tub before the laundry is loaded (or use the detergent dispenser, if available). Place the Oxi product directly into the bottom of the tub before adding the laundry (do NOT plane the oxi-product in the detergent, bleach, or pre-wash dispenser). NOTE: The SANITIZE WITH OXI cycle washer temperature can NOT be changed. The water is coming directly from the home water heater. The hot water supply connection must provide a minimum water temperature of 120-degrees Fahrenheit to ensure the effectiveness of this cycle.The SANITITZE WITH OXI cycle is certified by the NSF International, an independent third party testing and certification organization. The certification verified that the cycle reduced 99-9-percent of bacteria typically found in laundry and that no significant contamination is transferred to subsequent washer loads. The SANITIZE WITH OXI cycle has been designed to meet the requirements of NSF Protocol P172 for sanitizing effectiveness.

When this occurs, the washer is taking actions to correc the out-of-balance condition and complete the cycle normally.  In some cases, the washer may not be able to balance the load and spin-up to full speed.  If you notice the load is more wet than normal at the end of the cycle -- then, manually, re-distribute the load evenly in the tub and run a DRAIN-and-SPIN cycle.During spin if you see the SPIN light blinking - and - you also hear water fill the tub, agitating sounds, and no spinning, then the unit is attempting to auto-balance the load.  It will try the auto-balance sequence multiple times to successfully spin-up to full speed.  The sequence is as follows:The washer will stop spinning, will fill with a small amount of water, and agitate to re-distribute the load.The load will then drain and attempt to spin-up to full speed, but will only achieve this if the load successfully auto-balanced making a more evenly distributed load.If the load remains out-of-balance, the washer will try the auto-balance again.If the load never successfully auto-balances, the unit will cycle OFF, you may notice the load is wetter than normal, manually re-distribute the load, and run a DRAIN-and-SPIN cycle.If LID LOCK LIGHT IS FLASHING check your lid for the probe that sticks-out from the rim around the inner edge of the lid -- this probe engages and opening when the lid is down.  This is a safety feature to ensure the lid is down when the appliance is in spin mode.  If the probe is missing or damaged, I can send you another one.IF LID LOCK LIGHT IS ON (light is solid / not flashing) and LID LOCK is in the displayThe washer will not spin when it has water remaining in the tub.  Check to see if the washer can drain properly by ensure that the drain hose is not pinched, kinked, or flattened.You can reset the control panel by disconnecting from power for 2 minutes and re-connecting to power.  Set the cycle to DRAIN-and-SPIN to see if the appliance will operate properly.Different fabrics (towels, robes, sweatpants, denim, or other dense materials) absorb and retain moisture within the folds of the items following the spin cycle; also, cold water temperatures can make itmes feel heavier as if they did not spin-out enough.  In conditions like this, you can set the cycle to DRAIN-and-SPIN to spin the items again.Ensure that the washer is connect to a live working outlet.  It may be necessary to check the circuit breakers or fuses, and reset breaker or change blown fuses if needed.ALSO NOTE:The washer could be overloaded:  Reduce the load size.  When loading, the dry items to be washed should not reach any higher than the TOP ROW of holes in the tub of a top-loading washer.Select a cycle with a faster spin speed.  For instance, when using Delicates or Light wash, the spin speed is slower than other cycles like Regular, Heavy, Permanent Press, or Cottons; therefore, the load may retain moisture.Excess suds can also cause this problem.  If large amounts of suds are seen, re-wash the load WITHOUT detergent.  For  future loads, be sure to use the correct amount of detergent as prescribed on the detergent packaging.  Also consider using low-sudsing detergents.  GE recommends the use of H.E. (high-efficiency) detergents.The drain pump may be clogged -- a service call will be required to correct this issue.",

However, please schedule service as a PART INTERCEPT call for the gasket -- service must be scheduled to replace the gasket, the consumer cannot replace the gasket. FOR CONSUMER REPLACEABLE GASKETS (install date 2001 to present):  If the gasket is loose, before mail out, have the consumer try to push it back into the grooves on the door.  The gaskets can be pulled out.  Ensure that the gasket is pushed into the outer door so that it is fully seated.  If the gasket has been pulled out, it will allow warm air and moisture to enter the refrigerator causing temperature, moisture, and frost problems.  Push gasket back into place. A GOOD TIP:  Gaskets can become dry and not as pliable as needed to form a perfect seal.  If all other conditions are correct -- that is, good door alignment, normal internal temperatures, good vacuum door seal pressure, etc -- then apply a thin coat of petroleum jelly such as Vaseline to soften the gasket. This will allow for a tighter seal and eliminate condensation around the door gasket.  Once you receive the door gasket and it is installed, apply a light coating of petroleum jelly or wax on the face of the hinge-side of the gasket, this will allow the door to close and seal better.",

When the dryer heats the tumbling wet clothes, they dry only because the hot wet air escapes through the vent duct.  If the vent duct is not clear, or is compromised, the wetness stays inside the drum.  When the hot wet air cools, it condenses into water droplets (like a cold glass of water sweats), the water droplets can collect and run, causing leaking.   Have the vent duct checked and cleaned by a qualified dryer vent servicer (check the yellow pages).  GE Technicians do not clean or repair the vent duct for the dryer.  ELECTRIC DRYER TEST:  Remove the vent from the dryer and dry ONE load.  The moisture will evaporate into the house, but will be harmless.  If the load dries well with no issues, then the vent is clogged and needs to be cleaned.",

When the dryer heats the tumbling wet clothes, they dry only because the hot wet air escapes through the vent duct.  If the vent duct is not clear, or is compromised, the wetness stays inside the drum.  When the hot wet air cools, it condenses into water droplets (like a cold glass of water sweats), the water droplets can collect and run, causing leaking.   Have the vent duct checked and cleaned by a qualified dryer vent servicer (check the yellow pages).  GE Technicians do not clean or repair the vent duct for the dryer.\n </p>\n <p>\n  ELECTRIC DRYER TEST:  Remove the vent from the dryer and dry ONE load.  The moisture will evaporate into the house, but will be harmless.  If the load dries well with no issues, then the vent is clogged and needs to be cleaned.\n </p>\n <p>\n </p>\n</span>",

While it still has an ON / OFF switch, it will NOT have the GREEN LIGHT indicator.  The newly-designed icemaker will easily install and work in your refrigerator.",

Also, be sure the water supply line is properly installed according to the installation instructions provided in the Use and Care Manual.  Supply valve must have a 1/4-inch opening for water to fully supply ice maker.  Many self-piercing valves do not have this big of an opening.  Replace water supply valve with one that has a 1/4-inch opening.  Check to ensure that the copper tubing is not kinked in the back of the unit, restricting water flow to the icemaker.  If this line is kinked, it must be straightened or replaced by a plumber.  If no water is entering the ice maker tray, it is possible the fill tube has frozen.  In many instances, if the fill tube starts to freeze up, it is due to slow water flow to the ice maker. Slow water flow can be caused by several factors: incorrect installation, low water pressure, poor water quality, or clogged water filter. If there is an external water filter on the supply line, check to see if it needs to be changed.  Just as a clogged internal filter (some models) can complicate water flow to the ice maker, a clogged external filter can lower water pressure to the water valve.

To prevent freezing, the refrigerator should be kept at 34 degrees Fahrenheit - 40 degrees Fahrenheit, with an optimum temperature of 37 degrees Fahrenheit.  Check refrigerator temperatures by using an appliance thermometer.

The refrigerator should be kept at 34 degrees Fahrenheit to 40 degrees Fahrenheit, with an optimum temperature of 37 degrees Fahrenheit.  Check refrigerator temperatures by using an appliance thermometer.

It will take more time to cool than if the unit is a least 2/3 full.   Additionally, every time you open the door, you are trading room temperature air for the cool refrigerator air.  Again, the more you have in the refrigerator, the less air that will be replaced by room temperature air when you open the doors.  Put more food, containers filled with water, or anything that will take up space, in the freezer to at least 2/3 capacity.  Wait 24 hours for temperature to stabilize. Freezer too warm Check the freezer control, to make sure it has not been moved or bumped to a warmer setting.  Set the temperature controls as recommended in your Use and Care Manual.

Because the refrigerator runs more often, it maintains a more constant temperature for better food quality.  While this may sound like a long time for a refrigerator to run, modern refrigerators are 2/3 more efficient than older models.

When a large amount of food is placed in the refrigerator, it will transfer its warmth to the refrigerator, which will cause the motor to run more often as the refrigerator cools down the food. When the weather is hot, the refrigerator will run more often because it has to work harder to cool down.   During periods of high humidity, the refrigerator will run more often because it is working to remove the moisture from the air inside the refrigerator. If the doors are opened frequently or left open, cold air will escape from the refrigerator, and the motor will run more as the refrigerator tries to replace the cold air.

Also, when you stand near the unit, these regular normal sounds that you may have never noticed before, suddenly become apparent or more pronounced.  The refrigerator is combating the warm air in your home to cool your food properly.  In order to do this, there are certain sounds that occur when the refrigerator is going through the cooling processes. Compressor and Motor Sounds:  1.  The new high-efficiency compressors may run faster and longer than your old refrigerator and you may hear a high-pitched hum or pulsating sound while it is occurring.  This sound is normal in these units, it occurs after the unit has completed a defrost cycle.  A defrost cycle may occur every 6 - 20 hours depending upon the amount of door openings and food load.  The sound may last from 10 - 45 seconds. If the unit is holding your temperatures well and there is strong back-pressure (vacuum) just after the doors are closed, then the unit is performing perfect. When the doors of the refrigerator have been opened many times or for longer than 3 minutes, cool air is replaced with warm air.  This causes the refrigerator to have to run fans and the compressor in order to cool your food properly.  To reduce some running sounds, limit or reduce the frequency and the duration of door openings. 2.  The flow of refrigerant through the freezer cooling coils can make sounds like boiling water, gurgling, or pulsing.  Crackling or popping of cooling coils is caused by expansion and contraction during defrost and re-refrigeration following defrost.3.  In some models, prior to defrosting, your refrigerator goes into a pre-chill mode to make your item in the freezer very cold so that they do not melt during the defrost cycle.4.  Newer refrigerators do a lot more and provide a lot more features than older units.  This includes defrosting and in some models providing Ice and Water and other specialty chilled areas--like Beverage Centers, Quick Ice, Custom Cool, and Turbo Cool.  These special features can create more sounds because they require more motors and fans to run for longer times. These features can be turned off to eliminate excess sound. Evaporator Fan Sounds: 1.  The Fresh-food evaporator fan operates when the system is cooling (running).  The Fresh-food evaporator fan may change speeds in mid-cycle.  This is normal and required based upon the usage and sensed temperatures inside the refrigerator.  The changing of the fan speed may be noticed. 2.  The Fresh-food evaporator fan also operates when the system is defrosting.  This fan may run at a faster speed during defrost.  The changing of the fan speed may be noticed.3.  The Freezer evaporator fan only operates during a cooling cycle.4.  The length of the fresh-food cooling cycle, length of the fresh-food defrost cycle and fan speeds are dependent on usage and sensed temperatures.",

Therefore, the surface will most times feel about 20 degrees warmer than the room temperature, that is, if the room is at 70 degrees then the surface of the refrigerator will feel 90 degrees Fahrenheit. Warm air enters your refrigerator when you open the doors or store hot, warm, or room temperature items inside.  Refrigerant gas absorbs this warmth and cools the refrigerator compartments.  There is tubing which carries the hot refrigerant from the condenser to the surface of the unit, so that the warmth absorbed from the compartment is released harmlessly into the air in the room.  This keeps the internal temperatures cool and stable.  In addition, the hot gas flows onto the surface area to prevent the refrigerator from sweating.  The hot refrigerant helps the moisture build-up to evaporate. Your refrigerator is also equipped with an AUTOMATIC DEFROST CYCLE, which will make the internal temperatures become very warm to melt and drain away the frost that would collect on compartment surfaces.  You will notice WARMER internal temperatures on your read-out during this cycle. If your concern is that the surfaces are extraordinarily warm:1) For Non-Built-in units, ensure that there is 1-2 inches of air clearance around the refrigerator for good airflow.2) For BUILT-IN MONOGRAM UNITS, it may be necessary to clean the condenser coils on the refrigerator.  Refer to your Use and Care Manual for condenser coil cleaning instructions. Condenser Coil Operation for ALL ModelsCondenser coils work to remove warmth from the refrigerator compartment so that the cool internal temperatures remain stable.  The coils harmlessly release this warmth into the air in your home.  The condenser coils must be in contact with good airflow to work efficiently.  When the coils get dusty over time or from pet hair, good airflow around them is NOT achieved, and the warmth remains trapped in the hot gas tubing, and can be felt on the surfaces of the refrigerator.  With newly built homes, condenser coils may need cleaning because the appliance is usually installed before construction is completed.  Dust from construction settles on the condenser coils, reducing their effectiveness. With Monogram Built-in Models, you can refer to your Use and Care Manual for condenser coil cleaning instructions.  With all other models, the condenser coils cannot be reached and you must schedule service to have the Technician clean the coils.",

Pre-chill cool-down phase and Defrost warm-up phase. 2.  Average temperature reading throughout the entire compartment.  3.  24-hour waiting period to reflect recent temperature changes. 1.  Pre-chill and DefrostingYour refrigerator has an ACTUAL INTERNAL THERMOMETER read-out which can display the real-time temperature fluctuations which occur normally in the appliance, depending on which cycle it is in at the time. For instance, your refrigerator is equipped with an AUTOMATIC DEFROST CYCLE, which will make the internal temperatures become very warm to melt and drain away the frost that would collect on compartment surfaces. You will notice WARMER internal temperatures on your read-out during this cycle. To protect your items from the defrost cycle, the refrigerator will first lower its temperatures to make your items very cold; you will notice these COLDER internal temperatures on your read-out just before the defrost cycle. Both of these phases of the defrost cycle are temporary, so the unit should arrive back at (or around) your set temperature within 12 hours of the end of defrosting. 2.  Average Temperature ReadingIt is also normal for your chosen set temperature to differ from the read-out temperature by about 3 degrees because the read-out temperature is the AVERAGE temperature of the entire compartment from top to bottom.  Multiple door openings and long door openings (for loading food) can also affect the temperatures of the compartment.  Limit door openings to help keep temperatures stable. 3.  24-Hour Wait for Temperature ChangeIf you are adjusting your temperature, when you change the temperature and release the control, the previous temperature will return to the display.  This is because the controls are reading the actual temperature currently in the compartment.  You must wait 24 hours for your newly selected temperature to be reflected on the read-out. It takes 24 hours for the temperature to stabilize in the compartment.

The melted frost-water flows to the floor of the freezer and drains out through a tube to the evaporator -- this tube is the defrost drain tube.

The air rushing through the tube makes the bubbling or gurgling sound with the water -- like blowing air through a straw in a glass of water.2. GASKET:  When the doors are closed, a vacuum is created by the air-tight sealed compartment. The vacuum is strong enough to squeeze and collapse or flatten the gasket on the door. A flattened door gasket cannot keep the door sealed enough to maintain your set temperatures. To prevent this problem from occurring, the gasket has pores (or tiny holes) which allow air to pass which equalizes pressure in the gasket--it is this passing air you hear that creates the whistling sound.

        "raw_content": "Refrigerator:  Temperature:  Fluctuation => There are 2 reasons why your temperature may be incorrect or fluctuating: 1.  Pre-chill cool-down phase and Defrost warm-up phase. 2.  Average temperature reading throughout the entire compartment. 1.  Pre-chill and DefrostingYour refrigerator has an ACTUAL INTERNAL THERMOMETER read-out which can display the real-time temperature fluctuations which occur normally in the appliance, depending on which cycle it is in at the time. For instance, your refrigerator is equipped with an AUTOMATIC DEFROST CYCLE, which will make the internal temperatures become very warm to melt and drain away the frost that would collect on compartment surfaces. You will notice WARMER internal temperatures on your read-out during this cycle. To protect your items from the defrost cycle, the refrigerator will first lower its temperatures to make your items very cold; you will notice these COLDER internal temperatures on your read-out just before the defrost cycle. Both of these phases of the defrost cycle are temporary, so the unit should arrive back at (or around) your set temperature within 12 hours of the end of defrosting. 2.  Average Temperature ReadingIt is also normal for your chosen set temperature to differ from the read-out temperature by about 3 degrees because the read-out temperature is the AVERAGE temperature of the entire compartment from top to bottom. Multiple door openings and long door openings (for loading food) can also affect the temperatures of the compartment. Limit door openings to help keep temperatures stable. NOTE:  ZERO DEGREES in FREEZER at STARTUP - Some cold controls may begin with the Freezer reflecting ZERO DEGREES at first start-up.  This is only a default setting -- as the appliance has not started cooling either compartment yet -- this low initial temperature readout occurs only with the Freezer.  You should continue with the setting selection process -- press the temperature COOLER button ONCE to see the current (or default) internal temperature and press again to begin CHANGING the setting.  Continue pressing this button until your desired setting is in the display.  When you release the button, the display will return to the current internal (or default) temperature.  You will have to do this setting selection process for both compartments to achieve proper cooling. GE recommends 0-degrees Fahrenheit in the Freezer compartment and 37-degress Fahrenheit in the Fresh-food compartment.Over the course of 24-hours, you will notice the internal temperature changing to arrive at the set temperature.It is normal to see a difference between the internal temperature and the set temperature by about 3-degrees Fahrenheit (either warmer or cooler). This is due to airflow, food load, door openings, and the superchill followed by defrost cycles.  This difference is normal. USING YOUR OWN THERMOMETER TO MEASURE THE TEMPERATURE How is the temperature being determined? If a thermometer is being used, the preferred method is to place thermometer in a container filled with water on the bottom refrigerator shelf, on top of the veggie bins.  Allow 24 hours for the temperature to stabilize prior to checking thermometer.  With the refrigerator set to 37 degrees Fahrenheit, temperatures measure like this can be expected to range from 32 to 45 degrees Fahrenheit -- due to the following reasons:Location of thermometer in the refrigerator (Normally, the bottom shelf has more consistent temperature since it does not experience direct cold air flow.)Door openings (or, if door was left open).  Allows warm air to enter the refrigerator causing increased temperature.Defrost Cycles (can see as much as 46 degrees Fahrenheit during defrost).  Defrosts typically occur once every 24 hours.Loading warm food into the refrigerator (after storing cooked food or loading groceries).Some thermometers have a quick response to temperature changes.  When the refrigerator doors are opened, warm air emters the refrigerator, and can cause the temperature indicated by thermometer to be higher than the set temperature, especially when thermometer is not submerged in water.",

Increase slightly the amount of extra detergent and/or rinse agent.Hard water.  If you have hard water, make sure water is actually entering the dishwasher and that your inlet valve is not clogged. Clogged inlet valves are not covered by your service contract.  Contact your local plumber for assistance. Water hardness plays a determining role in the amount of detergent needed.  Generally, soft water requires less detergent while hard water requires more.  Spots on glasses or silverware may indicate a hard water condition.Water softener.  If you have a water softener, run the dishwasher only when the softener is full.  If the dishwasher is run after most of the soft water supply has been depleted, the dishes will not get clean, and they may look even dirtier than when they were put in.Rinse agent.  Use a rinse agent whenever possible.  Rinse agents allow water to flow off dishes quicker than usual.  This lessens water spotting and also makes drying faster.Fresh detergent.  Use powder detergent for best wash and rinse results.  Use only fresh, dry powder that is not clumped together.  Do not store it under the sink, because this can be a moist area.  If the detergent has clumped together, it may be too old and will not wash well.If your dishes are often heavily soiled, you may need to use detergent with a higher phosphate level, if it is available in your area.Water Temperature.  Your water heater should be set to at least 120 degrees Fahrenheit to obtain the best results from your dishwasher and detergent.  Run the hot water at the kitchen sink before starting the dishwasher to purge cooled water from the supply line or use the temperature boost option (on some models) to increase the water temperature.Obstruction.  If the spray arm holes are blocked with any type of debris (broken glass, seeds, plastic, etc.) the water will not be able to spray properly.  Remove any debris from the spray arms.  If a spray arm is stuck in one position due to an obstruction, it will disrupt proper water flow inside the dishwasher during use. Re-arrange how the dishes are loaded.  Make sure the spray arms can spin freely and the wash tower is not obstructed.  Avoid nesting items.Wash Cycle.  Heavily soiled dishes may need additional wash time.  Make sure you choose the appropriate wash cycle for the dishes being washed.  Different wash cycles have longer or shorter wash times.",

        "raw_content": "Dishwasher:  Detergent Dispenser => The SmartDispense detergent dispenser automatically dispenses liquid or gel dishwasher detergent into each cycle based on soil level and water hardness.  Detergent Use:  To utilize the SmartDispense Detergent dispenser, fill with any commercially available liquid or gel detergent that is specifically designed for use in an automatic dishwasher, like Electrosol or Cascade.  Do NOT add powder detergent, tablets, or any liquid soap or detergent used for in-the-sink dishwashing -- OR hand or body soap, shampoo, or laundry detergents -- in the SmartDispense system.  For best results, only re-fill the SmartDispense system with the same detergent brand AND formula.  If you must use a different brand, or perhaps a different formula of the same brand (like changing from Cascade Complete to Cascade Pure), we recommend waiting until the LOW DETERGENT indicator light is ON before doing so, as different detergent formulas -- even within the same brand name -- may not clean or dispense well when mixed.  To add detergent: Click here for a video pertaining to filling the SmartDispenser. 1. Remove the SmartDispense cap by PUSHING DOWN and turning the cap counter-clockwise until it comes off.  2. Set the door at a comfortable angle (or all the way open) to fill the dispenser.  3. Aim the detergent bottle at the opening in the door and fill.  The dispenser will hold 45 ounces of liquid or gel detergent -- a standard size bottle.  4. When full, re-seat the cap and turn clockwise until tight.  If residue remains on the door, it will wash away in the cycle.  5. A full dispenser will last 2-3 months with regular once-a-day use (of course, it will last longer with less frequent use and shorter with more frequent use).  LOW DETERGENT indicator light:  The indicator light has a dull RED lens, that will turn BRIGHT RED to notify you that the dispenser needs to be filled again.  The light will NOT turn off until the dispenser is filled and the door is closed. Use the open cup dispenser OR the bulk detergent dispenser, but NOT both.  Using both dispensers at the same time will put too much detergent into the wash water which can cause over-sudsing, as well as poor wash results.  In soft water areas, too much detergent may etch glasses and cause permanent damage to the glasses. If there is detergent in the bulk dispenser, you cannot use the open cup dispenser until the bulk dispenser low detergent light comes on.",

To add detergent:  Click here for a video pertaining to filling the SmartDispenser.1. Remove the SmartDispense cap by PUSHING DOWN and turning the cap counter-clockwise until it comes off.  2. Set the door at a comfortable angle (or all the way open) to fill the dispenser.  3. Aim the detergent bottle at the opening in the door and fill.  The dispenser will hold 45 ounces of liquid or gel detergent -- a standard size bottle.  4. When full, re-seat the cap and turn clockwise until tight.

A full dispenser will last 2-3 months with regular once-a-day use (of course, it will last longer with less frequent use and shorter with more frequent use).",

This film is Calcium Carbonate, which is naturally found in all water.  When water evaporates, like in a dishwasher, the Calcium Carbonate minerals are left behind on everything that was wet.Automatic Dish Detergent formulas worked very well are cleaning dishes when used with hot water, however, the water itself has Calcium Carbonate minerals naturally dissolved in it.  The Automatic Dish Detergent would normally contain PHOSPHATES that would bond with the Calcium Carbonate in the water.  The Phosphates and the Calcium Carbonate would then be rinsed away leaving clean, sparkling dishes.As recent as July 2010, beginning in the State of Washington, laws were passed that now prohibit Phosphates from being included in Automatic Dish Detergent formulas, other states are quickly adopting this requirement.  The manufacturers of the detergents are being proactive and are removing Phosphates from the formula of ALL detergents. Now that the detergents are Phosphate Free, consumers will now complain that the white film -- Calcium Carbonate -- which is naturally in the water, is now visible.  Detergents without phosphates tend to leave mineral deposits on glassware and other items, leading to poor wash performance complaints.  The deposits are in the form of a white film on glassware and other items, even the dishwasher tub itself.  When a customer is using phosphate free detergent and has recently observed a white film developing on his/her glassware, then we can safely assume phosphate free detergent is the problem. The automatic dishwasher detergent manufacturers are working to eliminate the phosphate free filming problem.  However, the problem will likely be with us for some time.  Therefore, dishwasher owners may have to repeat the citric acid (or vinegar) rinse several times a year, especially if they are using a lower performing detergent or are using the dishwasher without a rinse agent.",

If the dishwasher is not connected to the HOT WATER PLUMBING--meaning the water in the tub NEVER gets hot--contact your installer or a plumber, to correct.2.  You can also check the water temperature by running the hot water in a sink nearest the dishwasher, to its hottest point.  Run the water into a glass and check that temperature with a candy or meat thermometer, as well: Click to see a picture. 3.  To get the hottest water possible to the dishwasher, run the hot water faucet closest to the dishwasher prior to starting the dishwasher to be sure hot water enters the dishwasher on the first fill.

For certain fabrics, like 100% cotton, touching up with an iron may be required to fully eliminate wrinkles. GRID MARKS:  If you would like to de-wrinkle a light garment -- like 100% polyester undergarments -- by using the steam cycle, we suggest you ad a larger piece of fabric (like a small bath towel) to avoid your garment being sucked on to the grid.

You must be able to connect the dryer to a cold water faucet to supply water for the STEAM feature.  It may be necessary to contact a plumber to be sure that dryer has a cold water valve that can be used. 2. Ensure the dryer water hose is properly connected to the cold water supply. 3. Verify that the cold water is turned ON for the dryer. 4. Check your control panel selections, ensure that you have selected the option for STEAM DE-WRINKLE for 5 garments, or STEAM REFRESH for 6 or more garments -- the steam performs better when you use the option on more than a single garment.

When the dryer heats the tumbling wet clothes, they dry only because the hot wet air escapes through the vent duct.

If the load dries well with no issues, then the vent is clogged and needs to be cleaned.  TO PREVENT LEAKING FOR THE STEAM DRYER, YOU ALSO WANT TO BE SURE THAT:  You always run the steam cycle with garments in the dryer. Make sure the water inlet hose is properly tightened into the dryer water valve. Make sure both endings of the hoses contain rubber seals.  Sometimes when steam cycle is chosen, water condensed on the door and may drip when the door is opened -- this is normal. Please note, Steam cycles may have different labels on different models.  However, if a load has 5 -- or less -- garmets, using the De-wrinkle setting will put too much water on the clothes and will possibly cause a leak out of the basket.  Please, use the Refresh setting instead of De-wrinkle setting for a small load (5 or less)",

Do not use an extension cord.  d) House fuse blown or circuit breaker tripped. - Re-set the circuit breaker or replace the house fuse.  Dryers are typically connected to TWO fuses or TWO breakers, be sure to check them both.  If the problem is a circuit overload, have it corrected by a qualified electrician. e) Power outage has occurred. - Call your local electric company. f) Installation. - Verify the dryer is properly installed according to the Installation Instructions provided and there is power available to the dryer.  CAUTION: If you are not qualified to check for proper electrical supply, you may need to contact a professional electrician.  If the door has been reversed, refer to the Installation Instructions to ensure the reversal was done correctly.

Causes of restricted air flow are improper exhaust material and/or length, lint build-up on the lint filter or in the exhaust vent, or a restricted damper/weather hood.  Plastic and flexible foil vent material may fold over causing an air-flow restriction and should not be used. A rigid or semi-rigid metal vent duct should be used.

Please, check your yellow pages to locate an appliance servicer in your area for assistance with the duct.

Dry it thoroughly and replace.  Do not operate the dryer if the lint screen is not in place or tumbling items could enter the exhaust system and cause damage to the dryer.  To avoid the risk of carbon monoxide poisoning, never operate a gas dryer without an exhaust duct that vents outdoors. b) Exhaust duct is longer and/or has more 90-degree bends than recommended by the manufacturer.  Refer to the Installation Instructions for maximum length, number of elbows, and specifications for rigid and flexible metal ducts.  Install the dryer accordingly.  DO NOT use plastic flexible duct or metal foil duct. c) Exhaust duct is too small.  The minimum required exhaust diameter is 4 inches.  Do not use a smaller duct.  d) Exhaust hood is blocked.  Use an approved vent hood which has a swing-out damper(s) that opens when the dryer is in operation and closes automatically when the dryer stops to prevent drafts and to keep out insects and animals.  Do not attach a screen over the vent hood opening.  Maintain a minimum clearance of 12 inches between the bottom of the vent hood and the ground or any other obstruction.  Periodically, check the outside vent covers to ensure they have not gotten clogged with lint, preventing proper opening and closing. e) Inadequate ventilation.  If dryer is installed in a closet or under a counter, adequate ventilation is required for proper drying.  See Installation Instructions for requirements. f) Electric dryer is connected to a 210-volt circuit.  Drying time will be 20-percent longer than when the dryer is connected to a 240-volt circuit. g) Load is too small.  Drying only one or two items does not save time or energy.  Add similar items to the load to improve tumbling. h) Dryer is overloaded.  Reduce the load size.  The average washer load will fill the drum 1/3 to 1/2 full.

If you have recently painted or done any refinishing in your home, we recommend ventilating your home as thoroughly as possible.  You may also find it helpful to put wet rags in the dryer and let it run for 40 to 60 minutes after you have painted or refinished and before putting clothes in the dryer.\n </p>\n</span>",

Dryer sheets give off a residue to soften clothes, yet, this residue can clog lint filters after many uses if not cleaned properly. b)  Fabric Type - Clothing should be sorted according to fabric type.  Towels, flannels, chenille, cottons, rugs, shed lint.  Corduroys, knits (including socks), permanent press, and synthetics attract lint. c) Dryer overloaded - Do not overload the dryer.  Bulk, not weight, determines load size.  An overloaded dryer causes friction between garments and the clothing fibers to break.  The result is lint.  There should be space in the dryer for the clothes to tumble freely.  Large and small pieces together make up loads which will tumble well.  The average load size will fill the drum 1/3 to 1/2 full when wet. d) Clothes load too small - A load can be too small.  Just a few small pieces will not tumble properly.  They will take longer to dry and may wrinkle.  For small loads, add a couple of large towels or non-lint shedding items to aid in tumbling.  e) Always clean the lint filter after every load.  A clean lint filter ensures efficient drying, and clothes remain lint-free when unloading the dryer.  Please refer to your Use and Care Manual for specific instructions on how to remove, clean and replace the lint filter for your dryer model. f) Detergent residue - What appears to be excessive lint on your clothing may actually be detergent residue.  To eliminate detergent residue from clothes, wash the clothes without detergent using the correct water level and temperature for the load size.  Some clothes, such as heavy sweats, towels, jeans, may need to be washed several times before all the detergent is removed.  Some clothes may feel stiff after being washed with no detergent.

        "raw_content": "Dryer:  Cleanability => Please check each of the following to resolve issues of Cleaning the Dryer:Rust - Rust formation is caused by extended exposure to moisture and/or adverse conditions.  Environmental factors such as geographic location, room temperature, humidity, and product usage, affect the potential for rust to form.  Corrosives in the air, such as those created by processing plants, and salty ocean mists can also promote rust.  Nicks, scratches, or dents on the cabinet make the finish more vulnerable to rust, as does use of harsh cleaners.  Here are some suggestions to prevent rust on your appliance: -- Keep the appliance in a dry place. If you live in a warm, humid climate, keep the appliance in an air-conditioned room.  Do not keep it on a porch or breezeway. -- Keep the appliance clean.  Regularly wipe the exterior with a clean, damp cloth.  Use only mild, non-abrasive cleaners, such as dish soap or baking soda and water.  Thoroughly rinse any cleaner off and dry the surface with a soft cloth.  Additional cleaning guidelines are provided in your Use and Care Manual. -- Apply touch-up paint immediately on any scratches before rust has a chance to form and spread. Gum or Crayon - Use the following suggestions to remove chewing gum or crayon from the dryer drum: -- Place dry rags in the dryer drum.  Run the dryer for a few minutes to soften the crayon or gum. -- Apply one of the following cleaners to a soft cloth and rub off the gum or crayon: Goo Gone (found at most major discount stores or grocery stores), Mild nonabrasive cleanser without bleach, Detergent paste (powder detergent mixed with water).  After using a cleaner, run a cycle with damp rags before putting articles of clothing into the dryer. Drum discoloration - Some fabrics, such as denim or brightly colored cotton, and some fabric softener sheets may contain un-stable dyes that can transfer onto the dryers white interior surfaces.  To remove most discolorations, make a paste of powdered detergent and water.  Vigorously rub the paste onto the affected area.  The discoloration may not be totally removed but may fade or disappear over time.  If the dye has been heat-set onto the paint, it may be impossible to remove.  Drum discoloration caused by fabric dye transfer will not affect the dryers performance or harm other clothing. Grille at back of dryer discolored - Some discoloration of the heater-box outlet cover is normal due to the heat coming from the heater-box assembly.  This will not affect the dryers performance.  Make sure the type of vent duct material used on the dryer is made of 4-inch rigid or semi-rigid metal and is the proper length.  Refer to the installation instruction provided with your dryer for venting information. Restrictions in air flow may attribute to discoloration of the heater box outlet cover. - Check your vent duct weather hood on the outside of your home for blockage.  Clear any blockage of the weather hood and make sure the flapper moves freely.  Also, make sure the dryers lint filter is clean before starting a new load in the dryer.  Do not dry rubber-backed rugs, that may heat quickly and create excessive heat inside the dryer drum. Ink - Use the following suggestions to remove ink from the dryer drum: -- Place dry rags in the dryer, and while using the hottest heat setting, run the dryer for one hour to absorb the ink. -- Apply one of the following cleaners to a soft cloth, and rub the stain:  Mild nonabrasive cleanser without bleach, Detergent paste (powder detergent mixed with water), or Place wet rags in the dryer and while using the hottest heat setting, run the dryer for one hour to remove any cleaner residue.",
